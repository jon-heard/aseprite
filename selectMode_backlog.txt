- when selecting the current cell, but on a different frameview, it does nothing.  Fix that.
- don't allow drawing outside frameviews
- add block around frameview uis that allows selecting frameviews by clicking on them
- have cursor be arrow outside frameviews, but hand when over frameview ui blocks
- have frameview uis change color when cursor is hovering over their blocks
- have cursor preview show on hovered frameview even if not current frameview
